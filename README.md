Cat Vs Dog Image Classification Project | Deep Learning Project | CNN Project

1.Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images of cats and dogs, achieving high accuracy using layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense.

2.Applied data preprocessing and augmentation techniques (resizing, normalization, flipping, rotation) to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.

3.Evaluated and deployed the model with metrics such as accuracy and loss curves, and demonstrated prediction on new unseen images.
